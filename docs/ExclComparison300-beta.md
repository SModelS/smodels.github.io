# Exclusion Lines Comparison Wiki
A first draft of a page that collects all validation plots that show comparisons of statistical models:
best signal region only versus statistical models at varying degrees of complexity.
The list has been created from the database version 3.0.0-beta, considering also superseded results.

There is also a [ListOfAnalyses300-beta](https://smodels.github.io/docs/ListOfAnalyses300-beta), a [ListOfAnalyses300-betaWithSuperseded](https://smodels.github.io/docs/ListOfAnalyses300-betaWithSuperseded), and [Validation300-beta](Validation300-beta).
