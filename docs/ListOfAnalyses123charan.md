<a name='A1'>(1)</a> ''Home-grown'' result, i.e. produced by SModelS collaboration, using recasting tools like MadAnalysis5 or CheckMATE.

<a name='A2'>(2)</a> Please note that by default we discard zeroes-only results from FastLim. To remain firmly conservative, we consider efficiencies with relative statistical uncertainties > 25% to be zero.

<a name='A3'>(3)</a> Aggregated result; the results are the public ones, but aggregation is done by the SModelS collaboration.
