# List Of Analyses 2.1.0adl 
List of analyses and topologies in the SMS results database,comprising 33 individual maps from 21 distinct signal regions, 2 different SMS topologies, from a total of 2 analyses.
The list has been created from the database version `2.1.0adl.`
There is also an  [sms dictionary](SmsDictionary210adl) and a [validation page](Validation210adl).

<a name='A1'>(1)</a> ''Home-grown'' result, i.e. produced by SModelS collaboration, using recasting tools like MadAnalysis5 or CheckMATE.

<a name='A2'>(2)</a> Aggregated result; the results are the public ones, but aggregation is done by the SModelS collaboration.

<a name='A3'>(3)</a> Expected upper limits ('exp. ULs'): Can be used to compute a crude approximation of a likelihood, modelled as a truncated Gaussian.

<a name='A4'>(4)</a> Likelihood information for combination of signal regions ('SR comb.'): 'cov' = a covariance matrix for a simplified likelihood. 'json' = full likelihoods as pyhf json files.
