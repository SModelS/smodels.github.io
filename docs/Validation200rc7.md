# Validation plots for SModelS-v2.0.0rc7 

This page lists validation plots for all analyses and topologies available in
the SMS results database that can be validated against official results.
Fastlim results are listed; superseded results have been skipped. The list has been created from the
database version 2.0.0rc7, including the Fastlim tarball that is shipped separately.
There is also a [list of all analyses](ListOfAnalyses200rc7), and
a list of [all SMS topologies](SmsDictionary200rc7).

The validation procedure for upper limit maps used here is explained in [arXiv:1312.4175](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4175),  [EPJC May 2014, 74:2868](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-014-2868-5), section 4. For validating efficiency maps, a very similar procedure is followed. For every input point, the best signal region is chosen. The experimental upper limits are compared with the theoretical predictions for that signal region.
