# List Of Analyses 1.2.3rola (including superseded results)
List of analyses and topologies in the SMS results database,
comprising 2 individual maps from 1 distinct signal regions, 2 different SMS topologies, from a total of 1 analyses.
The list has been created from the database version `1.2.3rola`.
Results from FastLim are included. There is also an  [sms dictionary](SmsDictionary123rola) and a [validation page](Validation123rola).

<a name='A1'>(1)</a> ''Home-grown'' result, i.e. produced by SModelS collaboration, using recasting tools like MadAnalysis5 or CheckMATE.

<a name='A2'>(2)</a> Please note that by default we discard zeroes-only results from FastLim. To remain firmly conservative, we consider efficiencies with relative statistical uncertainties > 25% to be zero.

<a name='A3'>(3)</a> Aggregated result; the results are the public ones, but aggregation is done by the SModelS collaboration.
