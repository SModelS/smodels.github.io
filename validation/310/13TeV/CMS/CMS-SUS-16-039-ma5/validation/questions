-) the covariance matrix given in CMS-SUS-16-039_Figure-aux_027.root 
   is difficult to reconcile with the numbers given in table 12
   try sra01: covariance is 91, but error given is 22
   whats the meaning of this?

-) looking at fig aux 25, https://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/SUS-16-039/CMS-SUS-16-039_Figure-aux_025.png
   the root file contains the content of fig 18, not figure_aux 25

-) table 20, https://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/SUS-16-039/CMS-SUS-16-039_Table_020.png 
   has question marks for figures

-) neither with a priori nor with a posteriori, neither with 43 nor with 44 SRs
   can i reproduce the expected curves of TCHiWZ, figure 18
