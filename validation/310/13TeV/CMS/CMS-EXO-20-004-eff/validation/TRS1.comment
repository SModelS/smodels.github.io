comment: "The official scalar plots are plotted as a function of mu and hence the official exclusion lines were added by hand in oneDPlots.py in smodels-utils/validation for 1d plots of scalar. The TRS1 plots and TRPS1 plots share the same efficiency maps but have different production cross-sections.The SModelS TRS1 and TRPS1 plots are produced with a kfactor of 1.20 with cross-sections computed using 0j+1j (TRS1_0j_1j.tar.gz) and TRPS1.tar.gz respectively. The exclusion lines for TRPS1 2D plots were extracted using an online tool as there was no HEPData entry for the 2D exclusion lines. Efficiency Maps and production cross-sections were produced by Camila using MonoXSMS. The TRPS1 plots are present in the folder axial_and_pseudoscalar_plots."
