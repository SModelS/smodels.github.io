comment: "for SR-4Q-WW the upper limit on the fiducial cross section is 0.032fb. for m(C1),m(N1)=900,100 the acceptance is reported to be 5.4782%, the efficiency is 39.618%, resulting in an upper limit on the production cross section of 1.47 fb. Only a single signal region enters the upper limit. However, the upper limit map evaluated at 900,100 gev reports 1.8075 fb, a factor of 1.23 difference. for m(C1),m(N1)=500,200 the acceptance is reported to be 0.07158%, the efficiency is 29.173%, resulting in an upper limit on the production cross section of 153.24 fb. However, the upper limit map evaluated at 500,200 gev reports 500.7 fb, a factor of 3.24 difference. We do not know where this difference comes from. the efficiencies are in agreement with the cutflow table."
