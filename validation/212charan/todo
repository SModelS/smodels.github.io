=============
-) CMS-SUS-19-011: looks good, T8bbllnunu ignored because too long. T6bbWW is called T2bW by them, it is implemented but useless because only one plane in 3d.
-) CMS-SUS-19-008: T1tttt usable, rest is all just one plane in 3d
-) CMS-SUS-19-013: T5ZZ. done but fairly useless since only one plane in 3d ( gluino - neutralino2 always required to be 50)
-) CMS-SUS-20-001: T5ZZ, TChiWZ, TChiZZ okay. TSlepSlep is 100 gev off, no idea why.
